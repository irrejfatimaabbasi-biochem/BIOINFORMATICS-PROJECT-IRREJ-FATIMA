The phylogenetic tree demonstrates the evolutionary proximity of the CD4 molecule across primates, specifically highlighting that Homo sapiens and Pan paniscus (bonobo) share a recent common ancestor, as evidenced by their tight clustering and short branch lengths. In this phylogram, branch lengths represent the amount of genetic change (substitutions per site); the extremely short or zero-length branches between human reference sequences indicate nearly identical protein structures, while the small distance to bonobos reflects a high degree of purifying selection—where the essential immune functions of CD4, such as MHC-II binding, have remained largely unchanged over millions of years. This conservation is visually confirmed by the alignment asterisks, which mark residues that have been evolutionary "frozen" to maintain the molecule's role as a critical co-receptor and a primary gateway for primate lentiviruses like HIV and SIV.
