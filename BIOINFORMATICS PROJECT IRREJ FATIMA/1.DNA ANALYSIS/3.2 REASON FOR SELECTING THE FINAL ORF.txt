The final ORF was selected because the Query sequence demonstrated a 100% identity match to the curated human reference transcript (NM_000616.5), confirming it as the biologically correct sequence for Homo sapiens CD4. This selection is further supported by the 99% alignment with a "complete cds" cDNA clone, verifying the presence of an intact coding region from start to stop codon, and high evolutionary conservation with the Pan paniscus (Bonobo) sequence. The alignment data confirms that the reading frame is consistent across these high-confidence matches, ensuring that the chosen ORF encodes the functional CD4 protein rather than a non-coding fragment or a frame-shifted variant.
