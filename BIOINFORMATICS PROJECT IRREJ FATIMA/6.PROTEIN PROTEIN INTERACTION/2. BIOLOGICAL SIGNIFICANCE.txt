The interaction network of CD4 is fundamental to the human adaptive immune system. CD4 acts as a co-receptor that physically links the T-cell receptor (TCR) to the Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHCII) on antigen-presenting cells. By recruiting the kinase Lck to the proximity of the TCR complex, CD4 lowers the threshold for T-cell activation, allowing the body to respond effectively to very low concentrations of foreign antigens. Furthermore, this network is biologically significant in clinical pathology; the high affinity of the CD4-gp120 interaction makes this protein the primary gateway for HIV entry, leading to the depletion of CD4+ T-cells and the eventual onset of AIDS.
