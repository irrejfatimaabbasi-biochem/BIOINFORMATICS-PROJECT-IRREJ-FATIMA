Based on the InterPro domain architecture, the CD4 protein is predicted to function as a critical co-receptor in the immune system that facilitates T-cell activation and pathogen entry. The extracellular region contains four Immunoglobulin-like domains (such as IgV_1_CD4 and IgC2_2_CD4) that are responsible for recognizing and binding to MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, as well as serving as the primary receptor for HIV-1 gp120. The presence of a transmembrane domain and a specific cytoplasmic tail (Tcell_CD4_C) indicates that the protein is anchored to the cell membrane where it recruits the tyrosine kinase Lck to the T-cell receptor complex. This recruitment triggers essential downstream signaling pathways for T-cell development and immune response initiation.
