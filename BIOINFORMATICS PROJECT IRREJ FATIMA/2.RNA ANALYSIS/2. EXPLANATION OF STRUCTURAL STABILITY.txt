The RNA molecule is thermodynamically stable, as shown by the highly negative ensemble for free energy. 
However, it is structurally flexible, with stability spread across multiple conformations rather than a single dominant structure. 
This balance of stability and flexibility is often important for regulatory or functional RNAs
