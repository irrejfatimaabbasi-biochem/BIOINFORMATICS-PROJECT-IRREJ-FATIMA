SUMMARY:This bioinformatics study focused on the CD4 molecule to understand its genomic features, protein domains, and functional significance in the human immune system, along with its clinical relevance.
TOOLS:DNA sequence analysis and ORF selection were carried out using genomic and proteomic data from the NCBI and UniProt databases. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega, while domain architecture and functional predictions were analyzed using InterPro.
ACKNOWLEDMENT: I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Samena for her academic guidance and valuable support throughout the completion of this project. Her mentorship greatly facilitated this comprehensive investigation into the CD4 molecule.
